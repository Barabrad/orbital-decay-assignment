Homework assignment for Spacecraft Systems Engineering: simulates orbital decay due to drag and gravity

This code uses ode45 to propagate an orbit, given an initial state, until drag and gravity bring it to a final radius from Earth. A maximum number of orbits can be specified for the plots that do not use drag.
The atmosphericDensity.m file was provided by our professor.
